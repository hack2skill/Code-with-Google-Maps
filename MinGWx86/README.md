### A Brief of the Prototype:
In today's world, when someone's cell phone battery dies, and there's no place to charge it nearby, they find themselves in a tough spot. Even if there's a charging spot nearby, you'd have to stick around until your phone is fully juiced up. Our system offers a solution to this common dilemma, allowing users to go about their business while their phone recharges, all without worrying about their phone's safety.

Our plan involves setting up charging stations in public places, accessible to anyone who registers. Think of these Secure Charging Stations as vending machines, and they operate automatically using the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. When placed in stores, they not only provide convenience but also draw in more customers, keeping them in the store longer, which, in turn, can boost sales.

Cell phones have become indispensable tools for staying connected. They've evolved, becoming more powerful with faster processors and larger touch screens. However, their increased capabilities have led to higher power consumption. Unfortunately, battery technology hasn't kept pace with these advancements, resulting in the frequent need to recharge.

When people are on the move, the problem of charging electronic devices becomes even more pronounced. Most cell phone users have likely experienced the frustration of their phone running out of battery when they're far from a charging point. That's where our system comes in, making life easier for people in need of a reliable and convenient charging solution.
