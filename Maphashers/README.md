A Brief of the Prototype:

The approach deals seamlessly with  the integration of Google Maps APIs, harnessing their power for real-time traffic and geospatial data, and enabling data-driven decision-making. This integration informs green space allocation and maintenance scheduling, utilizing data such as population density, traffic patterns, land use, and accessibility. Furthermore, we leverage Google Maps' environmental data to assess the impact of green spaces, while our user-friendly interface promotes resident engagement and interactive mapping using Google Maps features. Our overall strategy focuses on efficiently allocating green spaces, optimizing maintenance schedules, ensuring accessibility, and enhancing environmental impact. Moreover, our system is highly scalable, making it applicable across diverse city sizes and geographical regions, with the overarching goal of enhancing urban sustainability, livability, and environmental well-being.

Tech Stack:
HTML, CSS, JS, python

Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
1. Clone the Repository

  Open a terminal or command prompt.
  Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
  Run the following command to clone the GitHub repository:
  
  git clone https://github.com/NearYagami/Green-Space-Managemant.git

2. By clicking on the "my current location" button the page gets loaded with the user's current location
   
3. Later we make use of the following APIs to get features for our regression model(not yet built):
   
   Google Maps Directions API: This API is used to optimize routes for accessibility and real-time traffic       conditions, ensuring easy access to green spaces and event venues.
   
   Google Maps Geocoding API: To convert location descriptions into geographic coordinates and vice versa,       facilitating data analysis and visualization.
   
   Google Maps Traffic API: For real-time traffic data to inform green space allocation and maintenance          scheduling, minimizing congestion and improving accessibility.
   
   Google Maps Places API: For gathering information about local businesses and restaurants to support the       local business collaboration aspect of the project.
   
   Google Maps Elevation API: To assess and enhance the environmental impact of green spaces, including          factors like elevation and topography.

4. Our Model gets trained and we will be able to take more precautions in the areas with higher pollution and 
   can also predict the future outcomes
   

Future Scope:

Data Analysis and Decision-Making: Utilize data analysis to interpret various datasets for informed green space management decisions. Our Model gets trained and we will be able to take more precautions in the areas with higher pollution and can also predict the future outcomes

Real-Time Information Processing: Continuously process real-time data to ensure dynamic and responsive green space management.

User Engagement and Feedback: Incorporate mechanisms for user feedback to enhance community involvement.
Route Optimization: Develop algorithms for efficient and traffic-aware event routing.

Environmental Impact Assessment: Calculate and visualize environmental data to inform green space creation and maintenance.

Local Business Collaboration: Establish partnerships and create offers for local businesses to enhance event experiences.

Scalability: Adapt the system to meet the needs of cities of varying sizes and regions.

Emergency Response Planning: Provide local authorities with event data for effective emergency response planning.
