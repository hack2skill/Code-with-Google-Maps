A Brief of the Prototype: TaxiMap is an app that allows Paratransit (Informal transit) riders to pay for trip fares online thus eliminating the need for cash. It also makes route and fare information more freely available. This innovative solution addresses two prominent pain points frequently encountered by taxi users: the inconvenience of cash-only payments and the lack of accessible information about routes and fares.

With TaxiMap, commuters no longer need to worry about carrying cash for their taxi rides. The app enables electronic payments, allowing users to pay their fares conveniently through digital wallets or cards. This feature eliminates the need for cash transactions, making taxi commutes more efficient and hassle-free.

One of the core advantages is its role as a comprehensive information hub for commuters. It serves as a one-stop solution for all essential trip-related data, including real-time route details and fare prices. This means users can access all the information they need in a single app, significantly simplifying their travel experiences. No longer will passengers have to rely on asking drivers or locals for directions or pricing information when venturing into unfamiliar areas.

TaxiMap's development is grounded in modern technology. It leverages the Flutter Firebase stack to ensure a robust and cross-platform user experience. Online payments are facilitated through the Rapyd Collect API, ensuring secure and seamless transactions. Additionally, the app integrates the Google Maps SDK and Directions API, providing accurate mapping and routing capabilities.

Google Maps was chosen as the mapping platform due to its well-established reputation for delivering precise directions. Furthermore, TaxiMap plans to integrate the Places API to further enhance the user experience by providing information about nearby points of interest.

This project has highlighted the importance of scope definition and prioritization in software development, ensuring that the app remains focused on its core functionality and user needs.

In terms of future enhancements, it aims to offer an improved trip history feature for drivers, streamline record-keeping mechanisms, and enable drivers to share QR codes for verification and convenience.

To elevate its routing capabilities, it plans to integrate the Google Maps Platform's new Routes API. This powerful API combines Directions and Distance Matrix services, offering features such as two-wheeler navigation, toll price calculation, and eco-friendly route options. Additionally, the app ensures a seamless and efficient cross-platform experience by utilizing Mobile Native SDKs for both Android and iOS.
