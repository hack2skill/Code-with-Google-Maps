### A Brief of the Prototype:

This section must include UML Diagrams and prototype description
_Description_:
The RoadSafety Web Application Prototype aims to enhance road safety and improve traffic management by allowing users to report road blockages, faults, and other issues in real-time. This application utilizes the Google Maps API to provide a user-friendly interface for reporting and viewing road incidents. It promotes community engagement and enables efficient incident reporting.
_Key Features_:

1. _Real-Time Incident Reporting_: Users can report road incidents such as potholes, accidents, roadblocks, and other issues through the application. The location and details of the incident are captured through Google Maps Api.

2. _Interactive Map Interface_: The application integrates Google Maps to provide a familiar and intuitive map interface. Users can easily pinpoint the location of incidents and view the map interactively.

3. _Custom Markers_: Users can mark incidents on the map using custom markers, making it easy to identify the type and location of each incident.

4. _Community Engagement_: The platform encourages community engagement by allowing users to contribute to road safety. It fosters a sense of responsibility and collaboration among users.

5. _Route Planning_: Users can plan routes, view traffic conditions, and receive real-time traffic updates to ensure safe and efficient travel.

### Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:

## To Start The Backend 

**Clone the repo**

``` git clone https://github.com/Tushar106/RoadSafety.git ```

**Open the RoadSafety**

``` cd RoadSafety ```

**Starting the backend**

``` cd backend ```

``` npm install ```

``` node index.js ```

**Create an .env**

```
PORT=8800
MONGO="mongodb+srv://<YOUR_MONGODB_NAME>:<PASSWORD>@cluster0.liyyi8h.mongodb.net/RoadSafety?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_GOOGLE_ID"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_GOOGLE_SECRET"
```

- NOTE : **MUST CONTAIN THE ACCESS FOR AUTH0**

## To Start The Frontend

``` cd frontend ```

``` npm install ```

``` npm start ```

**create an .env file**

```
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API= "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Future Scope:

**Futuristic Aspects:**

- Predictive Analytics: Incorporating machine learning and AI algorithms, the prototype can predict road safety issues based on historical incident data and current conditions. This can enable proactive measures to mitigate risks.

- Emergency Services Integration: In emergencies, the application can directly notify and coordinate with local emergency services, providing real-time information about incidents to expedite responses.

- Global Data Sharing: In the future, the application can facilitate data sharing with other road safety platforms and government agencies, creating a global network for incident reporting and analysis.
