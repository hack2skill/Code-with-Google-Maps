#### Problem Statement - Enhancing the Google Maps Experience through interactive AR Exploration
#### Team Leader Email - raimayankjbp@gmail.com

### A Brief of the Prototype:
  Our innovative project redefines exploration, making it more immersive and interactive. By harnessing Google's NeRF (neural radiance fields) technology, we enable detailed 3D photogrammetry, providing accurate shadows and depth to monuments and places. Combined with advanced statistics analysis and AR Core integration, our solution uses Google Maps platform to create an engaging experience. Users can seamlessly explore, learn, and discover places worldwide. Experience a new era of interactive mapping, enhancing your understanding of diverse cultures and landmarks effortlessly.
