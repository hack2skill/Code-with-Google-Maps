### Prototype Description

Our solar energy ecosystem solutions application offers a comprehensive set of features to assist users in seamlessly integrating solar energy into their homes and businesses. Here's an overview of the key components:

- **Data Collection and Integration:**

  - Collects user location data, including latitude and longitude or the user's address.
  - Integrates with Solar APIs to obtain real-time solar radiation, weather, and historical solar energy generation data.

- **Machine Learning Model:**

  - Utilizes a machine learning model trained on historical solar data, including solar radiation patterns, weather conditions, and energy generation statistics from the user's region.

- **Data Preprocessing:**

  - Cleans and formats data for machine learning analysis.
  - Performs feature engineering to extract relevant information such as average daily solar radiation and historical energy generation trends.

- **Solar Panel Recommendation:**

  - Recommends the type and capacity of solar panels suitable for the user's location.
  - Considers factors like panel efficiency, tilt angles, and shading analysis.

- **Placement Recommendations:**

  - Suggests the best locations and orientations for solar panel installation based on factors like roof layout, available space, and shading.

- **Budget Considerations:**
