# Team name = Double Trio ;

# Problem statement :
   We intend to provide a solution by establishing a
nationwide network to interconnect all rescue agencies within a unified
platform to collaborate and share their resources during natural/man-made
disaster.

# Team Leader Email : 22cs3075@rgipt.ac.in

# Brief about Prototype:
    We aim to systematically store images with precise location data (using the Geocoding API) and related notes, ensuring comprehensive record-keeping for future retrieval and contextual understanding. To notify users within a 2-kilometer radius, I recommend integrating the Nearby Messages API. This tool delivers location-based notifications to nearby users, enhancing engagement and communication. 

# Tech Stack:
  Website development: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Django, Python
  App development : Flutter
  Mapping: Geocoding API, Places API, Route API, Directions API,  Distance Matrix API, Geolocation API, Static Maps API
  Messaging system: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), Nearby messages API
  Database: GOOGLE CLOUD RDS (MYSQL)

# Scalability:
  The project aims to connect all rescue agencies nationwide, which means it needs to be scalable to accommodate a large number of agencies and users.
The system should be designed to handle an increasing volume of data, communication, and resource sharing as the network expands.
Scalability can be achieved through the use of distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, and efficient data management techniques.
The platform should be able to scale both horizontally (adding more agencies and users) and vertically (handling increased data and traffic).

# Future aspects:
  The project aligns with the ongoing advancements in technology and communication systems, leveraging them to enhance disaster management capabilities.
It can incorporate cutting-edge technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) for real-time data analysis, predictive modeling, and decision support.
Integration with geographic information systems (GIS) can provide valuable spatial data for mapping and visualizing disaster scenarios.
The platform can support mobile applications, allowing users to access critical information and services on the go, making it more convenient and accessible.
Future enhancements may include the integration of drones, robotics, and remote sensing technologies for efficient data collection, surveillance, and rescue operations.
