### A Brief of the Prototype:
  SpatialSage is our advanced tool that uses Google Maps to show where customers are most active. It helps businesses decide where to open stores and plan their marketing. By using real-time data from Google Maps, businesses get up-to-date insights to make informed decisions. SpatialSage is a user-friendly and intuitive tool that doesn't require advanced technical knowledge. Businesses of all sizes can easily integrate it into their decision-making processes. By leveraging real-time data from Google Maps, SpatialSage ensures that the information businesses rely on is always up-to-date and accurate. The tool provides actionable insights that help organizations optimize their operations and increase their chances of success. It offers a user-friendly platform for making informed decisions related to store openings, marketing strategies, and customer engagement. By visualizing customer activity and traffic patterns, Spatial Sage empowers businesses to thrive in an ever-changing marketplace. GOOGLE APIs: Maps JavaScript API: Embeds interactive Google Maps on the web tool, visualizing customer activity heatmaps and overlaying business data for user interaction and analysis. Places API: Retrieves surrounding places (e.g., cafes, competitors) near potential store locations, offering a comprehensive view of the local business landscape.

BUSINESS LOGIC: Data Collection: Fetching real-time Google Maps data and integrate with business metrics for timely insights. Data Integration: Validate and merge datasets, converting addresses to coordinates with the Geocoding API. Analysis & Modeling: Use algorithms to identify high-activity areas, assess competitors, and predict business potential. Visualization & Interaction: Overlay insights on an interactive map using the Maps JavaScript API. Recommendation Generation: Rank potential locations based on activity, competition, and accessibility, providing actionable marketing strategies. Feedback & Refinement: Iteratively improve the tool based on user feedback and market changes. Deployment & Monitoring: Launch on a web platform, monitor performance, and optimize API usage.
