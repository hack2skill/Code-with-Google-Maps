### A Brief of the Prototype:
In this prototype, our primary objective is to spotlight the capabilities of the recently launched Google Maps Solar API, emphasizing its potential and functionalities, both within an Android app and a web app.
Furthermore, within this prototype, we conducted an in-depth analysis by harnessing the Solar API to evaluate the feasibility of solar energy for customers prior to installing rooftop solar power systems. 
This analysis encompasses various crucial aspects, including rooftop area assessment, solar panel quantity determination, rooftop energy production evaluation, consumption analysis for profitability, project cost estimation, and Return on Investment (ROI) calculations.
Additionally, we leverage the Aerial View API to provide a 3D view of the buildings where rooftop solar panel setups are planned, offering a comprehensive understanding of the installation locations.
