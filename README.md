BUS YATRA is a mobile application designed to revolutionize intra-city government bus transport. This innovative platform offers real-time vehicle tracking, empowering passengers with the ability to locate buses effortlessly. It further enhances passenger safety by introducing a Driver Performance Score, evaluating drivers based on factors like braking, speeding, acceleration, turning, and adherence to routes. Environmental consciousness is promoted by disclosing vehicle emissions and energy-saving measures, such as electric buses. The app also provides insights into bus stops and driver profiles, fostering transparency and reliability. Utilizing AI, BUS YATRA calculates Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) based on live traffic conditions, streamlining travel planning and minimizing delays. Ultimately, BUS YATRA aims to transform government bus travel into an organized, comfortable, and sustainable mode of transportation, catering to millions of passengers while breaking new ground in the domain.
