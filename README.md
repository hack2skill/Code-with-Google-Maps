# Code-with-Google-Maps-2023 - Hack2skill

Welcome to the official repository for the Code-with-Google-Maps-2023 organized by Hack2skill!

## Getting Started

To get started with the Code-with-Google-Maps-2023 repository, follow these steps:

### Submission Instruction:
  1. Fork this repository
  2. Create a folder with your Team Name
  3. Upload all the code and necessary files in the created folder
  4. Upload a **README.md** file in your folder with the below mentioned informations.
  5. Generate a Pull Request with your Team Name. (Example: submission-XYZ_team)

### README.md must consist of the following information:

#### Team Name         - Meliora
#### Problem Statement - Development of an application for enhanced routing and road
safety of the users based on multiple factors
#### Team Leader Email - san.ravinutala@gmail.com

### A Brief of the Prototype:
A web application for enhanced routing and road safety of the users based on 
multiple factors like road information, volume of travellers over a route and its safety 
rating, users' vehicle information, emergency alerts and other traffic signs over the route
using Google Maps APIs and retrieve details and markers through API endpoints. 
The code allows users to vote for the suitability of a road for different types of vehicles (small vehicles, cars, and big vehicles), view road details, and add markers for new roads.
  
### Tech Stack: 
  1. Server side:
	a. Application:
	    Python: Flask framework
		          flask-SQLAlchemy ORM
	b. Backend:
			    SQLite RDBMS
2. Frontend:
	HTML
	CSS
	Jinja
	JavaScript
   
### Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
*Please note that these instructions are specifically for Windows Operating Systems, and they may vary for other operating systems.

1. Begin by downloading the provided folder, which contains all the necessary files.

2. Once you have downloaded the folder, open the terminal (cmd) within it.

3. Activate the virtual environment named "gmapenv" using the following command: "gmapenv\scripts\activate".

4. After successfully activating the virtual environment, you can check the code if you have IDE such as the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) installed.
5. Execute the following command: code ..

6. With the virtual environment set up, you can now run the application on your local server. In the command prompt, type and execute: "python main.py".

7. You can see the message: "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000."

8. Copy and paste the localhost address from previous step, which is "http://127.0.0.1:5000," into your web browser's address bar to view the application.

9. Press "ctrl+c" to stop the application from the cmd.
10. Type "deactivate" in the command prompt to deactivate the virtual enviroment.
11. type "exit" to exit the cmd.

  
### Future Scope:
   The future scope of the project includes user ratings, real-time data integration, advanced routing, customization, predictive algorithms, community features, dedicated mobile apps, multi-modal support, global expansion, and monetization opportunities. It has the potential for continuous improvement based on user feedback and evolving technology trends in mapping and navigation.
