#A Brief of the Prototype:

The Sustainable Living Guide is a mobile application that uses Google Maps Platform to guide users towards a more sustainable lifestyle. It helps users discover sustainable businesses and resources in their city, such as recycling centers. It also has a community forum where people can talk about sustainability .The main goal of the app is to promote sustainability by increasing awareness about sustainable businesses and resources. By providing a platform for users to learn about sustainability and make more eco-friendly choices, the app contributes to environmental conservation and promotes a healthier lifestyle.

Due to lack of time the UML Diagrams could not be presented . Sorry for that !

Tech Stack: front-end and back-end : We have used flutter to create the front-end and back-end. map integration : Google map platform is used to integrate apps programming language : Dart dev. platform : VS code

#Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions: the main.dart is the main file which is present in the lib folder . First download this prototype and open it in VS code (as I recommend). As the whole program is made in flutter , download flutter and dart extension in VS code and follow other basic steps to setup flutter . Then in the terminal type the command : cd sustainable_living_guide . This will chnage your directory . Then type the command flutter build apk to directly export it to apk which is avaliable in a new folder made just now named as build or we can either run the main.dart which is present inside the lib folder in a downloaded emulator .

#Future Scope The Sustainable Living Guide, as a mobile application, has immense potential for scalability and holds promising futuristic aspects. Here are some key points:

Scalability:

Geographical Expansion: The app currently helps users discover sustainable businesses and resources in their city. This can be scaled up to include more cities, regions, or even countries. The Google Maps Platform, which the app is built upon, supports global coverage, making this expansion feasible.
User Base Growth: As awareness and interest in sustainability grow, the user base of the app is likely to expand. The app's community forum feature can handle an increasing number of users, fostering a larger community of sustainability-minded individuals.
Feature Enhancement: The app can incorporate more features over time, such as personalized recommendations based on user preferences or behavior, integration with social media for sharing achievements or insights, or gamification elements to engage users.
Futuristic Aspects:

AI and Machine Learning: Future versions of the app could leverage AI and machine learning for advanced features like predictive analysis of sustainable trends, personalized content curation in the community forum, or smart recommendations of sustainable businesses.
AR Integration: Augmented Reality (AR) could be used to enhance user interaction with the app. For example, users could point their camera at a product and get information about its sustainability.
Blockchain and Sustainability Credits: Blockchain technology could be used to create a transparent and secure system for tracking and rewarding sustainable actions by users. Users could earn "sustainability credits" for certain actions, which could be redeemed at participating businesses.
In conclusion, the Sustainable Living Guide app has a robust foundation for scalability and a clear vision for incorporating future technologies. By continuing to evolve and adapt to users' needs and technological advancements, it has the potential to make a significant impact on promoting sustainable living.
