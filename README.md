### Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:



1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. To do this, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository and run:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/I-am-the-coder-Tusharbola/lone-tech-wolf.git
    ```


2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Once cloning is complete, navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd sustainable-living-guide-app
    ```


3. **Get Flutter Packages**: The project depends on a set of Flutter packages defined in `pubspec.yaml`. To download these packages, run:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

4. **Check Flutter Setup**: Before running the app, ensure that your Flutter setup is complete and there are no issues. Run this command to check:

    ```bash
    flutter doctor
    ```

   This command checks your environment and displays a report to the terminal window.

5. **Run the App in Debug Mode**: Now you're ready to run the app in debug mode. Start a debug session by running:

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

   This command runs your application and attaches a debugger to it.

6. **Build the App**: If you want to build a release version of your app, use the `flutter build apk` command:

    ```bash
    flutter build apk
    ```

   This command generates an APK file in the `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/` directory in your project.

   note --> You also have to change all the API keys . The google Map SDK for andriod is given in the ```andriodmainfest.xml``` file and the geolocation and places api are added in the ```welcome_screen.dart``` file present in the ``` lib folder ```






  
### Future Scope:
The Sustainable Living Guide app has a promising future scope given its focus on promoting sustainability and eco-friendly choices. Here are some potential scalability and futuristic aspects of the prototype:

Expansion to More Cities: The app currently helps users discover recycling centres in user's city city. In the future, it could be expanded to include more cities, even globally and also display all the sustainable businesses. This would make the app useful to a larger audience and promote sustainability on a larger scale.

Integration with Other Platforms: The app could be integrated with other platforms such as social media, e-commerce sites, and more. This would allow users to share their sustainable choices and inspire others to do the same.

Advanced AI Support: The AI Support feature could be enhanced to provide more personalized recommendations and tips based on the user’s lifestyle and preferences. It could also be trained to answer more complex questions about sustainability.

Gamification: To make the app more engaging, gamification elements could be introduced. For example, users could earn points for making sustainable choices, which could be redeemed for rewards.

Partnerships: The app could partner with sustainable businesses to offer discounts or special offers to users. This would encourage users to make more sustainable choices and support businesses that are doing their part for the environment.

Augmented Reality (AR) Features: In the future, AR technology could be incorporated into the app to provide users with an immersive experience. For example, users could see how a product is made or how much carbon footprint it has through AR.
