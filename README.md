**[Email Address of Team Leader: captainempire786@gmail.com]**

## Brief of the Prototype
Airomap is a pioneering platform designed to empower individuals and communities to actively engage in environmental preservation. Our mission is to establish an all-encompassing platform that allows users to report and monitor areas afflicted by issues such as pollution, litter, and other environmental concerns. By leveraging the capabilities of Google Maps and a network of environmental data APIs, Airomap bridges the gap between citizens and local authorities, fostering collaboration in the pursuit of a cleaner and more sustainable world.

### Current Prototype Key Features
1. **Real-time and Forecasted Air Quality Data**
   - Users can access real-time and forecasted air quality data for any location on the map.
   - Data includes pollution levels, historical data, temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and atmospheric pressure.

2. **User Interaction**
   - Secure login and registration for users to create personalized profiles.
   - Users can actively contribute their input on environmental conditions in their area.

3. **Statistics Section**
   - A dedicated section showcasing the top 100 cities worldwide, sorted by pollution rate.
   - Provides a global perspective on environmental challenges.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React Native
- **Backend:** Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
