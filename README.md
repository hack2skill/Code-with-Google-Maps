## Problem Statement

Every second counts when it comes to saving lives. Our revolutionary blood donation and availability tracking system ensures that patients in need receive the life-saving blood they require as quickly as possible. Donors can easily schedule appointments and receive notifications when their blood is used to help save a life.

### Unique Features

1. Patients can track the availability of their blood group in each blood bank.

2. Patients can find the nearest blood bank with their matching blood group.

3. Patients can navigate to the blood bank from within the app.

4. Patients can book blood tests in the app.

5. Special options for rare blood groups like requesting donors for urgency.

6. Donors get rewarded for donating blood in various forms, such as reward points that can be redeemed for gift cards or other prizes.

## A Brief of the Prototype:

1. The app consists of two view options, patients and donors.

2. Patients can register to our app with basic details and blood groups. The app will recommend all nearby hospitals and blood banks with matching blood groups available.

3. In case, none found patients can request our app to find some donors, where we can request some donors to donate urgently.

4. Rare blood group donors are rewarded with incentives and as per their will connected in the future in case of urgency.

5. Donors are the backbone of this system so if a donorâ€™s family or relatives are in need then our system manages blood for them based on the donation count of donors.

6. Regular donation camps are set up to encourage people to donate.
