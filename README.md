Welcome to the official repository for the Code-with-Google-Maps-2023 organized by Hack2skill!

## Getting Started

To get started with the Code-with-Google-Maps-2023 repository, follow these steps:

### Submission Instruction:
  1. Fork this repository
  2. Create a folder with your Team Name
  3. Upload all the code and necessary files in the created folder
  4. Upload a **README.md** file in your folder with the below mentioned informations.
  5. Generate a Pull Request with your Team Name. (Example: submission-XYZ_team)

### README.md must consist of the following information:

#### Team Name - Localis
#### Problem Statement - EstateEval: A web application to evaluate a property commprehensively on the basis of proximity to services/retail and quality of the area based various environmental factors.
#### Team Leader Email - 22f1000372@ds.study.iitm.ac.in and arjun.balaji.02@gmail.com
#### Team Leader Name - Arjun Balaji

### A Brief of the Prototype:
 EstateEval is a web application that harnesses Google Maps APIs to help users assess potential properties. It calculates a Proximity Score by measuring the distances to hospitals and transportation hubs and a Quality Score based on air quality, and various environmental factors. Users select locations on a Google Map, receiving immediate scores, aiding in informed real estate decisions. This application seamlessly integrates data and maps for a user-friendly and data-driven property evaluation tool.
  
### Tech Stack: 
  Front-End Tech Stack: HTML/CSS/JavaScript: The front-end of the application is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality
  Google Maps APIs and SDKs: Google Maps JavaScript API, Google Maps Geocoding API, Google Places API, Google Maps Distance Matrix API, Google Maps JavaScript SDK, Google Air Quality Index API
   
### Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  1) Download the folder and Open it using your Code Editor
  2) In the estateeval.html file and script.js file, ensure to enter your Google Maps API Key in the respective fields.
  3) Run the Landing Page file using Live Server to see the landing page of the website and click on Get started to move to the Evaluator part of the website.
  4) Alternatively, to see the Evaluation Web Application only, open the estateeval.html file using the Live Server Extension.
  
### Future Scope:
   Write about the scalability and futuristic aspects of the prototype developed
