Welcome to the official repository for the Code-with-Google-Maps-2023 organized by Hack2skill!

## Getting Started

To get started with the Code-with-Google-Maps-2023 repository, follow these steps:

### Submission Instruction:
  1. Fork this repository
  2. Create a folder with your Team Name
  3. Upload all the code and necessary files in the created folder
  4. Upload a **README.md** file in your folder with the below mentioned informations.
  5. Generate a Pull Request with your Team Name. (Example: submission-XYZ_team)

### README.md must consist of the following information:

#### Team Name - SolarCrafters
#### Problem Statement - Feasibility analysis of solar power solutions on building rooftop
#### Team Leader Email - nikunjkumar_kapupara@persistent.com

### A Brief of the Prototype:
In this prototype, our primary objective is to spotlight the capabilities of the recently launched Google Maps Solar API, emphasizing its potential and functionalities, both within an Android app and a web app.

Furthermore, within this prototype, we conducted an in-depth analysis by harnessing the Solar API to evaluate the feasibility of solar energy for customers prior to installing rooftop solar power systems. 

This analysis encompasses various crucial aspects, including rooftop area assessment, solar panel quantity determination, rooftop energy production evaluation, consumption analysis for profitability, project cost estimation, and Return on Investment (ROI) calculations.
Additionally, we leverage the Aerial View API to provide a 3D view of the buildings where rooftop solar panel setups are planned, offering a comprehensive understanding of the installation locations.

### Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
    Android Mobile:
    - Clone the repo "PlatformSolutions-Mobile", where you can find all the prototype implemented source code.
    - Import project in Android Studio.
    - Click on Clean from Build menu.
    - Connect your android device or open Android Virtual Device from Device Manager
    - Select "app" and Select your connected device or Virtual device
    - Run the project/app
    
    Web Application:
    - Clone the repo "PlatformSolutions-Web", where you can find all the prototype implemented source code.
    - Import project in Visual Studio Code.
    - Open the Terminal and run the command "npm install --legacy-peer-deps" and "npm start"
  
### Future Scope:
Enhanced Wealth Meter: The Wealth Meter's features are adaptable to calculate a user's wealth based on the number of energy-consuming devices and their consumption rates. This customization provides a more detailed and precise analysis of potential profits under various configuration scenarios.

Auto-Complete Functionality: The current prototype does not include the auto-complete feature for places due availability of this service, but it's part of our future integration plans.

User Profile Management: In the existing prototype, user details are not stored in the database. However, we have plans to implement this feature in the future.

Data Layer Visualization: We can integrate data layer visualization on the user interface, including Digital Surface Model, RGB composite layer, mask layer, annual and monthly solar flux, and hourly shading. This enhances the visual representation of critical information.

Indian-Specific Subsidiary Information: In collaboration with service providers, we consider additional incentives and government subsidies specific to India when planning solar configurations. This ensures a comprehensive understanding of the solar setup's potential benefits in the Indian context.
