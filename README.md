### A Brief of the Prototype:
  This section must include UML Diagrams and prototype description

  	Creating a prototype for an augmented reality (AR) navigation feature within Google Maps for urban areas with heavy traffic congestion is a complex and time-consuming process that requires technical expertise and resources. Below, I'll provide a simplified, high-level outline of what a prototype could involve, but keep in mind that developing a functional prototype for such a project would typically require a team of developers, designers, and access to the necessary technologies and APIs.

	The prototype will demonstrate the core functionality of the AR navigation feature. It will include a basic user interface, mapping integration, real-time traffic data, and AR capabilities.

### Tech Stack: 
   List Down all technologies used to Build the prototype

   > Python
   > Matlab 
   
### Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  This Section must contain a set of instructions required to clone and run the prototype so that it can be tested and deeply analyzed

  The architecture flow of a project that implements an augmented reality (AR) navigation feature within Google Maps for urban areas with heavy traffic congestion can be complex and multifaceted. Below, I'll provide a high-level overview of the architectural flow:
User Input and Destination Selection: Users enter their starting point and destination in the app's UI. They activate the AR mode for navigation.
Route Calculation: The app calculates the initial route using the Google Maps APIs, considering real-time traffic data. The selected route is displayed on the map.
Real-Time Data Updates: The app continuously updates the traffic data from the Google Maps Traffic API. Dynamic route adjustments are made based on real-time traffic conditions.
Alternative Transportation Options: Users can explore alternative transportation modes if congestion is severe. The app integrates with third-party services for real-time availability and booking.
Destination Arrival: Users receive notifications and guidance as they approach their destination.
Feedback and Data Collection: Users can provide feedback on the navigation experience. Data on route usage and user behavior is collected for analysis and improvement.
	This architecture flow illustrates the interaction between the key components and the flow of information and services in the AR navigation application. It's important to note that this is a simplified overview, and the actual implementation can be more complex, requiring robust server infrastructure, databases, and third-party service integrations.

### Future Scope:
   Write about the scalability and futuristic aspects of the prototype developed

   The business logic of a project involving an augmented reality (AR) navigation feature within Google Maps for urban areas with heavy traffic congestion encompasses several key components and strategies. Here's an outline of the business logic for such a project:
User-Centric Approach: The project's business logic starts with a user-centric approach. Understanding the needs and pain points of urban commuters is essential. User feedback and surveys can provide valuable insights.
Marketing and Outreach: Develop a marketing strategy to attract users to the application. This can include advertising, partnerships with transportation services, and promotional campaigns.
Traffic Data: Collect real-time traffic data, user location data, and community-reported incidents to continually improve traffic predictions and route optimization.
User Behavior Analysis: Analyze user behavior within the app to understand how users interact with the navigation feature. This data can inform feature improvements and business decisions.
Data Security: Implement strong data security measures to protect user data, location information, and any personally identifiable information (PII).
	The business logic revolves around creating a valuable, user-centric navigation experience while generating revenue through various monetization strategies, data analysis, and community engagement. It's essential to balance user needs with revenue generation and to continuously adapt and improve the service to remain competitive and meet the demands of urban commuters.
