                    Generating revenue with solar cells often involves a combination of factors, including government
                    incentives,
                    energy production, and various financial arrangements. The specifics will depend on your location
                    and
                    individual
                    circumstances. It's essential to consult with a solar energy expert or financial advisor to
                    determine the best
                    revenue-generating strategy for your situation.
