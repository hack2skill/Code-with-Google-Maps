### A Brief of the Prototype:
This project is designed to develop a visualization tool that can accurately depict the shadows cast by the sun at various times throughout the day. Utilizing 3D models of solar panels, the tool aims to assist individuals and businesses in visualizing potential solar panel installations. The ultimate goal is to enhance understanding and planning of solar energy utilization.
  
### Tech Stack: 
  The project uses HTML, JavaScript and CSS for it's implementation
  Google Maps Platform
  Deck.gl
  ThreeJS
  GoogleMapOverlay
  google-maps-plugin-ThreeJSOverlayView
  WebGl-2


  Google Maps API - Solar API / Places API / Map Tiles API/ Maps Elevation API / Map JavaScript API / Geocoding API / Geolocation API/ TimeZone API /

### Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:

### Future Scope:
   Adding Solar Panel where Google's Solar API is not available, by creating a 3D model using the outline of the building
   Using Raycasting to detect the shadows casted on the individual solar panel by the 3D models of the Photorealistic 3D Building
   Adding GlobeView using deckgl
   Collaborating with local and Global Vendors/Agencies of solar panels to provide efficient and cleaner way to harness the power of solar energy
